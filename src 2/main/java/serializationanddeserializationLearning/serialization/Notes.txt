If you want a class object to be serializable, all you need to do it implement the java.io.Serializable interface.

Serializable in java is a marker interface and has no fields or methods to implement.
Itâ€™s like an Opt-In process through which we make our classes serializable.

Serialization in java is implemented by ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream, so all we need is a wrapper over them to either save it to file or send it over the network.
