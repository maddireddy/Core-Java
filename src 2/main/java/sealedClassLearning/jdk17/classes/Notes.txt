Permitted subclasses have the following constraints:

They must be accessible by the sealed class at compile time.

For example, to compile Shape.java, the compiler must be able to access all of the permitted classes of Shape: Circle.java, Square.java, and Rectangle.java. In addition, because Rectangle is a sealed class, the compiler also needs access to FilledRectangle.java.
They must directly extend the sealed class.

They must have exactly one of the following modifiers to describe how it continues the sealing initiated by its superclass:

final: Cannot be extended further

sealed: Can only be extended by its permitted subclasses

non-sealed: Can be extended by unknown subclasses; a sealed class cannot prevent its permitted subclasses from doing this

For example, the permitted subclasses of Shape demonstrate each of these three modifiers: Circle is final while Rectangle is sealed and Square is non-sealed.
