A record and the components in its header might be decorated with annotations, such as the following:

public record Transaction(
    @NotNull String id,
    @Positive double amount) {
    // ...
}
The Transaction record example shows annotating the id and amount fields with @NotNull and @Positive annotations, respectively.
