Records are implicitly final, meaning they cannot be extended or declared as abstract.

// These won't compile:
abstract record Payment(String id) { }
final record LimitedPerson extends Person(String name, int age) { }
The examples demonstrate that declaring an abstract record (Payment) or trying to extend a normal class (LimitedPerson) with a record will not compile.
