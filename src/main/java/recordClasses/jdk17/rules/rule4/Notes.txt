Records cannot have instance fields or instance initializers beyond the component fields defined in the record header.

public record Point(int x, int y) {
    private double distanceFromOrigin; // Won't compile

    {
        // Instance initializer won't compile
        distanceFromOrigin = calculateDistance();
    }
}
The example Point record illustrates that declaring an instance field (distanceFromOrigin) or an instance initializer block will not compile.
