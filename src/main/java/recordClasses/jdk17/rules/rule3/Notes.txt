The component fields of a record are implicitly final, which means their values cannot be changed after the record instance is created.

public record Transaction(String id, double amount) {
    // This won't compile - attempting to change a final field:
    public void changeAmount(double newAmount) {
        amount = newAmount;
    }
}
The example shows that attempting to change the amount field in the Transaction record's changeAmount() method will not compile.
