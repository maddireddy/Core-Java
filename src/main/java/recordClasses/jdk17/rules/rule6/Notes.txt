Record classes cannot declare native methods. Native methods depend on an external state, which goes against the immutable nature of records.

public record Stock(String symbol, double price) {
     // Won't compile - native methods not allowed
     public native void updatePrice();
}
The Stock record example shows that declaring a native updatePrice() method will not compile.
