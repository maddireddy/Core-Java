/*
In Dynamic binding compiler doesnâ€™t decide the method to be called.
Overriding is a perfect example of dynamic binding.
In overriding both parent and child classes have the same method.

Methods are not static in this code.
During compilation, the compiler has no idea as to which print has to
be called since the compiler goes only by referencing variable not by the type of object,
and therefore the binding would be delayed to runtime and therefore the corresponding
version of the print will be called based on type on an object.
